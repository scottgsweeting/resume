## Motorola/Avigilon (formerly Openpath Security, Inc.)
### Senior Staff Firmware Engineer
#### September 2020 to present

I've moved firmware development at Openpath in a new, higher-quality, better-performing direction. Specifically, I:
1. Introduced code reviews (pull requests), code review checklist.
2. Introduced unit testing, greatly improving code quality, portability (in anticipation of changing chips), and development time. We are also able to prototype firmware changes before we even receive hardware.
3. Introduced test-driven development, improving firmware modularity, architecture, time to develop new drivers, and time to bring up new boards.
4. Introduced static analysis (cppcheck) of unit-tested code which finds logical flaws at compile time.
5. Introduced dynamic analysis (valgrind) of unit-tested code which finds uninitialized memory access and memory leaks.
6. Dockerized the unit testing/static analysis/dynamic analysis development environment -- making tests portable and reproducible.
7. Wrote clean code that is easily read and easily modified.
8. Rewrote projects to get us off of Arduino, adding unit tests, static analysis, and dynamic analysis.
9. Implemented Memfault remote debugging -- immediately finding three bugs causing constant reboots in the field.
10. Merged several projects improving code re-use, driver development time, and board bring-up time, as well as adding test features for Electrical Engineers. I did this without introducing bugs to the firmware.
11. Supported project planning and issue-tracking for firmware.
12. Coached teammates on test-driven development, unit testing, object-oriented development in C, clean coding and guided team to a more disciplined approach to changing and improving code.
13. Drove the firmware projects -- requirements, design, implementation, and testing.
14. Spread relevant and useful online technical seminars to the team in general and the dev team in particular.

In summary, I changed firmware development from quick and dirty to clean and high quality.

## Mobilogix
### Senior Firmware Engineer
#### October 2018 to January 2020

I managed projects and developed firmware for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). I was primarily responsible for cellular-connected battery-powered sensor hubs and asset-trackers. Projects consisted of bare metal and ThreadX and uC-OS projects on ATMEL SAMD20, SiliconLabs BlueGecko family, and Quectel BG96 and MC90 modems. Notable sensors include Bosch BMA250 accelerometers/gyroscopes, temperature, pressure, humidity, ambient light and GPS/GNSS, WiFi and Bluetooth LaaS. Focused on ultra-low power firmware designs with 1 year plus power profiles, sending telemetry via MQTT on cellular networks.

## Vyaire Medical
### Principal Firmware Engineer
#### June 2016 to November 2017

I developed Class C safety-critical firmware for a Class III medical device (hospital ventilators) using C++ on Texas Instruments (TI) MSP430, TI F2803x, TI F2806x microcontrollers. I re-wrote the motor controller firmware for the F2806x with DRV8301 3-phase brushless DC motor in Class C firmware specification. I worked on sensors and valve controllers that were connected to a central device controller via SPI, and the sensors themselves were SPI hosts for ADCs and EEPROMs. Used pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), host-side unit testing, and live system acceptance testing incorporating requirements traceability for FDA auditing. Wrote software architecture and hazard analysis documents.

## Renkus-Heinz
### Firmware Architect
#### August 2014 to June 2016 

Spearheaded Scrum project management transition. I implemented a long-term software development lifecycle program that brought issue tracking, a regression-testing regimen, coding standards, and process documentation to Engineering department. Implemented the layer 2 Ethernet command protocol (AVDECC), communicating over I2C to the audio DSP to set signal flow parameters using fixed-point algorithms, communicating with slave devices over RS485, detecting power supply drops via ADC. Developed firmware in C using MQX RTOS in CodeWarrior.
